        CultureFit is a platform for recruiters to evaluate candidates beyond the resume,
        by focussing on workplace culture fit. This was completed as an individual project
        during the full-time UX Program at Brainstation.

      <Content heading="Identifying the Problem Space">
        Drawing from my own experience in recruitment, I decided to think about the
        recurring challenges for recruiters. I noticed that despite having the right
        skills on their resume, some candidates did not last more than 6 months on the
        job. The reason? They did not fit into the workplace culture. To ensure there was
        no bias, I decided to start with research to lead my journey.
        <Content heading="Preliminary Research Findings" level={2}>
          The term “culture fit” means the alignment of goals and values between the
          employee and their workplace.
          <CenteredImage src={images.research1} margin="40px auto" alt="" />
          Hiring employees that don’t mesh well with the existing workplace culture leads
          to poor work quality, decreased job satisfaction and a potentially toxic
          environment. This results in turnover which has high costs both in time and
          money.
          <P>
            Upon further investigation, I found that workplace culture fit independently
            predicts commitment, job satisfaction and job performance.

        <Content heading="Market Research on Current Initiatives" level={2}>
          Current practices to ensure culture fit include measures like preparing{' '}
          <b>behavioural interview questions</b>, involving a{' '}
          <b>cross-functional selection committee</b> in the screening process, or giving
          the candidate a <b>company tour</b> to understand their workplace culture.
          However, all of these measures are <b>time-consuming</b> and{' '}
          <b>not data-driven</b>.

      <Content heading="Design Challenge">
        My project goal was to help recruiters make data-driven candidate selections to
        ensure workplace culture fit, and ultimately lower turnover. In other words,

      <Content heading="Empathizing with the Target Users">
        After conducting research, I did some user interviews to further validate my
        hypothesis that creating a platform to assess the alignment of a candidate to the
        workplace culture will help recruiters in the selection process, and reduce
        turnover.

              Newer recruiters with little to moderate experience are more likely to need
              assistance with the selection process and less likely to rely on “gut

                Overall, recruiters were aware that workplace culture fit is important and

                Recruiters need a platform to assess a candidate’s alignment with that
                workplace culture to ensure fit.

      <Content heading="Understanding the Target Users">
        To ensure that the user stayed at the forefront through the process and to build
        empathy for a more meaningful solution, I created a primary persona (Jennifer
        James) to look at some of their <b>goals, frustrations and motivations</b>.
        <CenteredImage src={images.targetUser1} alt="" />I then, created an{' '}
        <b>experience map</b> of what the <b>current recruitment process</b> looks like
        for my persona in order <b>to identify possible opportunities for intervention</b>
        .
        <CenteredImage src={images.targetUser2} margin="50px auto" alt="" />
        The main opportunity here is to intervene early and provide a platform for
        recruiters to assess a candidate’s culture fit even before getting to interviews.

      <Content heading="User Stories and Task Flow">
        Once I found the opportunity for my persona, it was time to create user stories.
        By doing this, I aimed to define the minimum set of product features which would
        help users achieve their goals, whilst also providing valuable learnings and
        insights into how the product is used and what other needs users may have that
        could be solved in future iterations.
        <CenteredImage src={images.userStory1} alt="" />
        Based on the user stories I created a task flow diagram. This task flow shows the
        series of steps to <b>create a customized candidate assessment</b>.

        To better understand how users would expect to interact and navigate through the

        sketching. I used inspirations from other existing UI components and looked at
        functionalities from apps LinkedIn, Monster and Indeed for ideas.

                    Getting feedback early on, no matter how rough the ideas are, is
                    invaluable. What might be obvious to you might not be to the user. The
