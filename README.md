Steps to publish
- Make any changes to `dev` branch, do not touch `master` branch
- Run `npm run deploy` after making changes to `dev` (these changes do not have to necessarily be pushed to github)
- Refresh [your website](https://saanchla.com/) to see current changes (it may take several minutes to show up)
